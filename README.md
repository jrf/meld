### Themes

synthwave, monochrome, ocean, sunset, matrix, tokyo night moon

### Configuration

Settings are stored in `~/.config/mdr/config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "tokyo night moon"
scrollbar = true
```

Themes live in `~/.config/mdr/themes/` as individual `.toml` files. The theme name is derived from the filename (hyphens become spaces, e.g. `tokyo-night-moon.toml` → "tokyo night moon").

Example theme file (`~/.config/mdr/themes/tokyo-night-moon.toml`):

```toml
[colors]
bg = "#222436"
bg_highlight = "#2f334d"
fg = "#c8d3f5"
fg_bright = "#d5dff5"
comment = "#636da6"
fg_gutter = "#3b4261"
red = "#ff757f"
yellow = "#ffc777"
green = "#c3e88d"
blue = "#82aaff"
magenta = "#c099ff"

[ui]
border = "fg_gutter"
accent = "magenta"
text = "fg"
text_bright = "fg_bright"
text_dim = "comment"
text_muted = "fg_gutter"
heading = "blue"
error = "red"
cursor_bg = "bg_highlight"

[labels]
bugs = "red"
features = "green"
improvements = "magenta"
refactor = "yellow"
docs = "blue"
chore = "comment"
```

- Each theme file has a `[colors]` palette (hex `#rrggbb`), a `[ui]` section mapping roles to palette names, and a `[labels]` section for category colors
- All fields are optional — missing fields fall back to a hardcoded default
- Add new themes by dropping a `.toml` file in the themes directory
- Requires a truecolor-capable terminal

## Requirements

- Rust (stable)
- A terminal with truecolor (24-bit) support
