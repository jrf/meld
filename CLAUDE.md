# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Run

```bash
cargo build              # debug build
cargo build --release    # release build
cargo run -- <file.md>   # run directly, opens in reader mode
cargo run                # no args: opens file picker
just install             # release build + codesign + copy to ~/.local/bin/
just run <file.md>       # shorthand for cargo run
```

No tests or linter are configured yet.

## Architecture

mdr is a terminal markdown reader built with Rust, ratatui, and crossterm. It renders markdown in the terminal with syntax highlighting and live-reloads on file changes.

**Five app modes** (`AppMode` in `state.rs`): `Reader` is the primary mode. `FilePicker`, `Search`, `ThemePicker`, and `Help` are overlays drawn on top of the reader. `ThemePicker` stores the original theme index so it can revert on cancel. All overlay modes return to `Reader` on dismiss.

**Single-threaded event loop** (`main.rs`): Uses `crossterm::event::poll` for input and an `AtomicBool` flag (set by the notify file watcher) for file changes. Only redraws when state actually changes. Global keybindings (`q`, `Ctrl-c`) are handled first, then mode-specific bindings are dispatched.

**Rendering pipeline**: `ui::draw` always renders the reader first, then overlays the active modal (file picker, theme picker, or help) on top. The reader calls `markdown::parse_markdown` which converts the full markdown source into a `Vec<StyledLine>` using pulldown-cmark. The UI then slices this by scroll offset and renders via ratatui. There is no caching — the entire document is re-parsed on every redraw.

**Key modules**:
- `main.rs` — event loop, file watcher setup, terminal init/cleanup, external editor launch.
- `state.rs` — `AppState` holds mode, scroll position, theme, file content, search state, and `BrowserState`. Mode transitions and scroll/search logic live here.
- `browser.rs` — `BrowserState` manages directory listing (dirs first, then `.md` files, hidden files excluded), selection, scroll, and type-to-filter for the file picker overlay.
- `markdown.rs` — pulldown-cmark event loop producing styled, word-wrapped lines. Handles headings, code blocks, blockquotes, lists (ordered/unordered), task lists, inline formatting, and horizontal rules.
- `ui.rs` — ratatui rendering: reader with status bar, plus centered popup overlays for file picker, theme picker, and help. Search highlighting is applied post-parse in `highlight_search`.
- `theme.rs` — six color themes using 256-color indexed palette (`ALL_THEMES` array). Default is "tokyo night moon" (index 5). Themes are cycled at runtime with `t`.

**Key dependencies**: ratatui 0.30, crossterm 0.28, pulldown-cmark 0.12, notify 7, unicode-width 0.2. Version matters — ratatui and crossterm APIs change significantly between major versions.

**Search system** (`state.rs`): Case-insensitive substring search across raw content lines. `open_search()` enters Search mode, `update_search()` scans on each keystroke, `search_next()`/`search_prev()` cycle matches. Highlighting is applied in `ui.rs` via `highlight_search`.

**File picker** (`f` key): Opens a centered overlay listing `.md` files and directories from the current file's parent dir. Supports type-to-filter, directory navigation, and opens selected files in reader mode with a new file watcher.

**External editor** (`main.rs`): In reader mode, `e` suspends the TUI, launches `$EDITOR` (or `vi`) on the current file, then restores the TUI and reloads content.

## Workflow Rules

- **TODO.md must be kept meticulously updated.** When completing a feature or fix, add it to the Done section. When discovering new work, add it to the appropriate section (Now/Next/Later).
- **README.md must be kept meticulously updated.** When adding or changing features, keybindings, configuration options, or setup instructions, update the README to match.
